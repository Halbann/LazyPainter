An addon for Textures Unlimited that provides an alternative UI designed for colouring large numbers of parts simultaneously.

Click on individual sections within parts, types of sections, or groups of colors to make simultaneous adjustments in a single window where you can toggle secondary and detail colour slots, toggle recolouring altogether, edit colours with HSV or RGB, change material settings, and save your favourite colours into TU's existing preset system.

Check the 'i' menu in the top right of the window for a list of controls. The important ones are:

- **Click on sections** of parts to select them. Some parts have many sections, and some parts have one section or none at all.
- **Double click** to select **all sections** on a part at once.
- **Shift click** to **add** more sections to the selection.
- Click in empty space to **clear** the selection.
- Click **'Paint'** to **activate recolouring** for the selected sections.
- **Right click** a **colour slot** to enable/disable it.

**This mod doesn't provide any recolouring capability by itself. You need Textures Unlimited and your choice of texture sets (usually Textures Unlimited Recolour Depot).**
