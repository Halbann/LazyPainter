An addon for Textures Unlimited that provides an alternative UI designed for colouring large numbers of parts simultaneously. 

Click on individual parts, types of parts, or groups of colors and make simultaneous adjustments in a single window where you can toggle secondary and detail colour slots, toggle recolouring altogether, edit hue, saturation and value or RGB, change material settings, and save your favourite colours into TU's existing preset system.

Check the '?' menu in the top right of the window for a list of controls. The important ones are:

- Click to select.
- Hold shift: Add parts to the current selection.
- Hold control: select all parts of the same type.
- Hold control alt: select all parts of the same colour.
- Alt click: copy that part's colours to the palette.
